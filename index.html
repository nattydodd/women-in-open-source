          New for this year's event is a dedicated space to share experiences
          and discover
          <span class="highlight">Women in Tech and Open Source.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          It's no secret that there are a lack of women in our industry, or that
          women often choose to leave. At this event, let's get inspired by
          Women in Open Source and highlight them by adding them to a public
          repo for others to discover. Add names and links to the repo by
          creating
          <span class="highlight">Pull Requests</span> that will count towards
          the Hacktoberfest challenge. This space is also the perfect place to
          <span class="highlight">ask questions</span>,
          <span class="highlight">share experiences</span> and
          <span class="highlight">network</span> with peers and allies.

        <h2>> Open Source is Dominated by Men</h2>
        <p>
          Numbers for women in the tech industry are already pretty bleak, but
          theyâ€™re even worse in Open Source projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this doesn't mean there aren't plenty of women we can look up
          to and get inspired by! All of the women you see on our list are
          inspiring women who have done amazing things for the Open Source
          community.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are also tons of really cool initiatives going on right now to
          improve diversity in Open Source!
